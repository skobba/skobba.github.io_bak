# Retrospectives

Low participation during a retrospective can prevent a project team from making meaningful process improvements. Some effective techniques to encourage participation include:

__Pose a group question and ask for individual responses.__

*It may be helpful to pose a question like, “What was one success and one challenge you experienced on this project?” and then ask each team member to share. Beyond that, be sure to create a safe environment for honest discussion, model exemplary participation, and review the project timeline.*

__Model the kind of participation you’d like to elicit from your team.__

*You can model participation by sharing your own examples of successes and challenges. Beyond that, be sure to create a safe environment for honest discussion, pose questions and ask for responses, and review the project timeline.*

__Review the project timeline.__

*You can share the project timeline to ensure the retrospective covers more than just recent successes and challenges. This may help the team to think further back in the project life cycle. Beyond that, be sure to create a safe environment, model exemplary participation, and pose questions and ask for responses.*

__Establish a safe environment for the team.__

*To create a safe environment, remind the team that the retrospective is a meeting free from stakeholders or customers. You should also tell them that it’s safe to discuss problems. Beyond that, be sure to model participation, pose questions and ask for responses, and review the project timeline.*
