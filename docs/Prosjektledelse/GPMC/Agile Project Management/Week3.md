## User Stories
Include the following elements: 
* User persona. What is your user like? What is their relation to the project? What goals do they have? 
* Definition of Done. This refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a user story can be considered complete. 
* Tasks. What are the key activities needed to complete the user story?
* Any feedback already provided. If you are adding features to an existing product and you have already received feedback from customers on a past iteration, make sure to consider this feedback.  

__I.N.V.E.S.T.__ 

Criteria: 
* __Independent:__ The storyâ€™s completion is not dependent on another story.
* __Negotiable:__ There is room for discussion about this item.
* __Valuable:__ Completing the user story has to deliver value. 
* __Estimable:__ The Definition of Done must be clear so that the team can give each user story an estimate. 
* __Small:__ Each user story needs to be able to fit within a planned Sprint.
* __Testable:__ A test can be conducted to check that it meets the criteria.
