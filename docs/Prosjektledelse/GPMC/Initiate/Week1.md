## Cost Benefit Analysis
_The process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs._

* Establish project goals
* Create the scope
* Provide deliverables
* Define success criteria

### Benefits
* Minimize risks and maximize gains for projects
* Reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions
* Help you make a strong business case

### Guiding questions
To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:
* What value will this project create? 
* How much money could this project save our organization? 
* How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
* How much time will it save? 
* How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:
* How much time will people have to spend on this project?
* What are the one-time costs?
* Are there any ongoing costs?
* What about long-term costs? 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:
* ___Customer satisfaction.___ Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
* ___Employee satisfaction.___ Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
* ___Employee productivity___. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
* ___Brand perception.___ Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?
