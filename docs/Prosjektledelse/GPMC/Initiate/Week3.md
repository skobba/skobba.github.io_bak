# Working with stakeholders

## Roles and responsibilities

* The right skills and abilities to fill the role
* Who is available?
* What motivates them?

__Pre-assignment__, the sponsor assigns team members to your project.

*Many people avoid discussing their differences, but if you encourage those conversations, you will find a richer understanding and greater creativity that comes from people working together across identity differences. To do this effectively, it is important to dedicate time early on in the team building process to develop trust between team members.*

Team size, skills, availability, and motivation are the building blocks to creating your very own dream team. Always keep in mind that a project manager does not just select dream teams, they create dream teams through collaboration under great leadership.

## Roles
__Stakeholders__
* Primary - directly affected by the outcome of the project.
* Secondary - indirectly affected by the outcome of the project.

## Evaluating stakeholders
Questions for stakeholders:
* What are your most important priorities/goals?
* How will this initiative/project support you and your most important priorities?
* What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?
* Here’s how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?
* What can I clarify for you?
* What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?
* What would success look like for you?
* Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative?
* What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
* Where do you see me getting support for this initiative? Facing resistance?


### Stakeholder Analysis
Ref.: [Stakeholder-analysis-and-power-grid](Stakeholder-analysis-and-power-grid.pptx)

Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts.
* Who is invested in the project?
* Who is impacted by this project?
* Who contributes to this project? 

Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder—this step helps you determine who your key stakeholders are. Factors that will play a role in determining a stakeholder’s ability to participate in a project, like physical distance from the project and their existing workload. Various types of stakeholders—some will be active stakeholders with more opinions and touchpoints and others will be passive stakeholders

You might want to form a steering committee during some projects. A steering committee is a collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project. A steering committee can influence multiple departments within the organization, which means that they have the potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager.

### Prioritizing stakeholders and generating their buy-in
* Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder.
* Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team.
* Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.
