# Working with stakeholders

## Roles and responsibilities

* The right skills and abilities to fill the role
* Who is available?
* What motivates them?

__Pre-assignment__, the sponsor assigns team members to your project.

*Many people avoid discussing their differences, but if you encourage those conversations, you will find a richer understanding and greater creativity that comes from people working together across identity differences. To do this effectively, it is important to dedicate time early on in the team building process to develop trust between team members.*
