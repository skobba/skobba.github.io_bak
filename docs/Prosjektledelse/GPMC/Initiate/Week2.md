# Defining project goals, scope, and success criteria

## SMART Goals
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

SMART goals are well-defined goals that help keep projects on track. Theyâ€™re specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. SMART goals are measured with figures or numbers known as metrics. Benchmarks are used to help confirm the accuracy of metrics.

* What do I want to accomplish?
* Why is this a goal?
* Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?
* Who is involved?
* Who is the recipient?
* Employees, customers, the community at large?
* Where should the goal be delivered?
* Finally, to what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints?
