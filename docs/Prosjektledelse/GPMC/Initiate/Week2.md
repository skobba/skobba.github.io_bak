# Defining project goals, scope, and success criteria

## SMART Goals
* __Specific__: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
* __Measurable__: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
* __Attainable__: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
* __Relevant__: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
* __Time-bound__: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

SMART goals are well-defined goals that help keep projects on track. They’re specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. SMART goals are measured with figures or numbers known as metrics. Benchmarks are used to help confirm the accuracy of metrics.

* What do I want to accomplish?
* Why is this a goal?
* Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?
* Who is involved?
* Who is the recipient?
* Employees, customers, the community at large?
* Where should the goal be delivered?
* Finally, to what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints?
