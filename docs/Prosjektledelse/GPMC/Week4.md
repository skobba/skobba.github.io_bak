# Week4 - Organizational structure and culture
Project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively regardless of sructure.

## Classic and Matrix structure
### Classic
*Your authority may be slightly limited due to competing priorities, approval chains, and other complexities, but setting expectations up front will enable you to navigate the organization and execute your project successfully.*

### Matrix
*The Matrix structure differs from the Classic structure in that the employees have two or more managers. In Matrix structures, you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments with whom you will need to communicate on your work progress.*

Some project managers or department leads may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.

### Project Management Office (PMO)
PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers. They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves. The main functions of a PMO include:
* Strategic planning and governance
* Best practices
* Common project culture 
* Resource management
* Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools
