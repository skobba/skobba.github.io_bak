Google´s __Five factors__ that impact team effectiveness are:
* Psychological safety
* Dependability
* Structure and clarity
* Meaning
* Impact

## Providing "air cover"
Air cover refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of out-of-scope requests or criticism from leadership.

__Saying “No” without explicitly saying “No”__

One way to provide air cover to your team is to say “no” to your sponsor’s request without explicitly saying “no.” 

There are a few ways to do this:
* You can gently push back with a polite explanation that their request won’t be possible to complete under the current constraints—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project. 

* You can politely offer to get back to the stakeholder with your response. This gives you time to better understand the request and to consult with trusted team members to lay out the benefits and costs of this request. And, if you are lucky, this might even give the stakeholder the opportunity to reconsider their request or forget about it entirely.

__Intervening from behind the scenes__

Another way project managers provide air cover for their teams is to master the challenge of  delicately intervening from behind the scenes when a stakeholder is making unrealistic requests or offering unreasonable critiques.

This doesn’t mean you need to come up with a solution all by yourself, however. Instead of calling a team meeting to discuss the stakeholder’s request for a new flavor, you consult with only two trusted members of your team to help brainstorm solutions.

## Bruce Tuckman's five stages of team development
* Forming
* Storming
* Norming
* Performing
A performing team has already established its working procedures. Processes and workflows should already be in place as the team works together relatively seamlessly to complete tasks, reach milestones, and make progress toward the project goal. During the norming stage, you should codify norms, communicate them to the team, and reinforce them when needed.

* Adjourning
