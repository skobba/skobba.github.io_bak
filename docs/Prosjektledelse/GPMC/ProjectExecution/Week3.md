# Data-informed decision making

__Data__ is information. It’s the numbers and feedback available to you about different aspects of your project. __Metrics__ are how you measure your data. 

## Productivity metrics
Productivity metrics typically measure progress and output over time. They allow you to track—or predict—the effectiveness and efficiency of your project team.
* Milstones
* Tasks
* Projections - helps to predict an outcome based on the information the project team has now
* Duration

## Quality metrics
* Changes
* Issues
* Cost
* Happiness and satisfaction
* Customer satisfaction scores

__Adoption metrics__

For a product or service release, like an app, software program, delivery service, or gym membership, would be similar to the party example. However, they can be a bit more complex if you need to track metrics for more than one thing, like whether users make additional purchases or sign up for premium features. 

Eg.:
* Conversion rates
* Time to value (TTV)
* Onboarding completion rates
* Frequency of purchases
* Providing feedback (rating the product or service)
* Completing a profile
