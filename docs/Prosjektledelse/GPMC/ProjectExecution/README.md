# Project Execution

## Tracking and measuring project progress

### Gantt charts
One of the most popular tracking methods and can be used for all types of projects. Gantt charts typically live in your project plan and are updated as the project progresses.

Gantt charts are useful for:
* Helping a team stay on schedule
* Projects with lots of tasks, dependencies, and milestones
* Projects with large teams, because ownership and responsibilities are explicitly laid out visually

### Roadmaps
Roadmaps also track both individual and project progress toward milestones. However, Roadmaps are best suited for tracking big milestones in your project. 

Roadmaps are useful for:
* High-level tracking of large milestones. Roadmaps outline the project as a whole and provide an overall snapshot of key pointsâ€”just like an actual roadmap contains points of interest and mile markers. 
* Illustrating to your team or key stakeholders how a project should evolve over time

### Burndown charts
Typically used by Agile Scrum teams and reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying how much work is left and how much time remains to complete the work. 

Keep the project team on top of targeted completion dates and make them aware of scope creep if it occurs. The chart should be displayed so everyone can see it and needs to be updated regularly in order to be effective.

Useful for:
* Projects that require a detailed review of tasks
* Projects where finishing on time is the top priority
