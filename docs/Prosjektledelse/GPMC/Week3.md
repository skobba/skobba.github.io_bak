## Initiate a project
* Who are the stakeholders?
* What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
* What is the purpose and mission of the project?
* What are the measurable objectives for the team?
* What is the project trying to improve? 
* When does this project need to be completed? 
* What skills and resources will the project require? 
* What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

## Make a plan
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  

Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

* Create a budget
* Set the schedule
* Establish your team
* Determind roles and responsibilities
* Plan for risk and change

## Executing and completing tasks
* Manage the progress
* Communicate
* Make adjustments

Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 

Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 

Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.

Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.

Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

## Closing a project
* Ensure all tasks are completed
* Confirm acceptance of the project outcome
* Reflect on lessons learned (retrospective)
* Communicate results with stakholders
