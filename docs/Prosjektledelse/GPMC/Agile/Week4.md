# Applying Agile in the organization

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

As you read, ask yourself: 
* What is the issue?
* What is the goal of the analysis?
* What is the context of the problem?
* What key facts should be considered?
* What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
* What would you recommend, and why?

## Value Roadmap - Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:
* Project roadmap
* Product roadmap
* Value roadmap
* Lean roadmap
* Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

__Benefits of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous:__
* Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 
* Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 
* Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)
* Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

__Pitfalls to avoid:__
* Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teamsâ€™ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.
* Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer
* Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

__Best practices__
* Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.
* Clearly indicate the highest priority items.
* If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.
* Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 
* Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.
