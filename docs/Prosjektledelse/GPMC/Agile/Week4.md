# Applying Agile in the organization

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

As you read, ask yourself: 
* What is the issue?
* What is the goal of the analysis?
* What is the context of the problem?
* What key facts should be considered?
* What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
* What would you recommend, and why?

## Value Roadmap - Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:
* Project roadmap
* Product roadmap
* Value roadmap
* Lean roadmap
* Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.
