# Applying Agile in the organization

When reading case studies, focus on the problem, the effect it had on the business or organization, and the pros and cons of the solutions reached to help you determine some applicable key takeaways.

As you read, ask yourself: 
* What is the issue?
* What is the goal of the analysis?
* What is the context of the problem?
* What key facts should be considered?
* What alternatives are available to the decision-maker?
* What would you recommend, and why?

## Value Roadmap - Benefits, pitfalls, and best practices
Each team or company may interpret the roadmap slightly differently. Here are some of the various types:
* Project roadmap
* Product roadmap
* Value roadmap
* Lean roadmap
* Agile roadmap

Roadmaps are often represented visually and many try to fit the roadmap on one page so that reviewers can notice the big picture of the product timeline.

__Benefits of developing and maintaining a product roadmap are numerous:__
* Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 
* Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 
* Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)
* Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

__Pitfalls to avoid:__
* Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teams’ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.
* Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer
* Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

__Best practices__
* Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.
* Clearly indicate the highest priority items.
* If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.
* Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 
* Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

## Responding to change over following a plan
The best way to think about changing your plan is to break it down into three stages:
* Identifying a needed change 
* Deciding to make the change
* Implementing the change

### Step 1: Identifying a needed change 
Here are some aspects of your project that may be candidates for change: scope, time, and costs (or resources). As we previously learned, these are called the “triple constraint,” and they provide a great framework for evaluating change in Agile and traditional projects.

* In Agile, __scope__ refers to the contents of the product roadmap, the items in the Product Backlog, the intended deliverables of the project, and the intended users or customers. This is the “what” of the project.
* __Time__ refers to the elements of time or layout of the deliverables over a period of time. This could include the product roadmap timeline, release schedule, or even the Sprint duration. This is the “when” of the project.
* __Costs or resources__ refer to the makeup of the Development Team, project managers, and product owners, and other “business people” as well as the equipment available to create the deliverable. This is the “how” of the project.

Agile projects are open to change in any of these three areas, and a needed change could be identified by any project stakeholders, including the Product Owner, Project Manager, Scrum Master, or the Development Team themselves. Sources of identified changes could include:
* Customer feedback on early prototypes results in new features and some deleted features (scope change)
* Sprint Retrospective identifies an area of understaffing (cost or resource change)
* Critical project dependencies or deliverable dates have shifted, resulting in a change to the project roadmap (schedule or time change)

### Step 2: Deciding to make the change
Next, how do you decide to actually make the change? There are many decision-making models available to reference. Here are the basic steps involved in most of these models:
* __Identify the “decider.”__ It is best to have a single person—generally the Product Owner or a senior stakeholder—in the role of decider to ensure consistency and accountability. 
* __Develop and share what factors are important to the decision__, and gather supporting data that will help the decider make the decision.
* __Openly discuss the benefits and costs of the decision.__ Identify areas of uncertainty and capture assumptions.
* __Document the decision.__

### Step 3: Implementing the change
Once changes are approved, it is important to do several things:
* __Document the change and decision-making process.__ Include meeting notes, pros/cons lists, assumptions, and data that went into making the decision to change the project.
* __Capture the change in any affected artifacts.__ Update any roadmaps, Product Backlogs, staffing plans, and integration dates, and include a reference to the source of the change so that stakeholders can refer back to it. Consider using revision labels or dates on affected documents like “version 1.2” or “updated on December 20th” so that the team can clearly recognize that the document has changed.
* __Share the change with all affected stakeholders.__  You can do this through many types of forums: in person at meetings, in documentation and meeting notes, and through email announcements. 
* __Monitor the change for a certain amount of time.__  This ensures that the team is supportive and aware of the change.

*If the change was not approved during the decision stage, you should still document the information and logic used to make the decision. You may even consider putting a change on hold while you wait for more information to make the decision with higher confidence.*
