# Stakeholders
*Synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent summary that clearly communicates the issue.*

*Rather than sending your stakeholders a link to the plan and pointing out all of the overdue tasks, you might summarize the problem by telling them a number of tasks have run past their due date because of supplier issues. So we recommend hiring a second supplier to hit the deliverable date. Otherwise, we'll need to push the launch date back.*
