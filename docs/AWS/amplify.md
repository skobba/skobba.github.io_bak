## Notes and findings
By choosing Amplify as infrastructure and CI there are certain choises that are made and desisoins that are taken for you.

Identify which ones.
* Some adjustments to make nextjs fit to Amplify like "next build && next export" identifies that itÂ´s a SSG (static site generation) app.
* Need to use the "amplify" command from adding/removing components from your app and for CI commands.
* What to do if we need to create a new AIM user (in aws)?
* What to do for a new developer to enter the team.
* Mono/multi-repo - Choose the best match for local dev and CI env.
* Folder structure - Find a structure for best matching local dev and CI env, who does "amplify init" to be used in monorepos (can/should it be run muiltiple times?).

Findings
* [https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/#prerequisites](https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/#prerequisites)
* Lots of deprecated and security warnings from build and setup
