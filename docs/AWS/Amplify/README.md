# Amplify
Framework that creates and manages a bunch of services in AWS, see also the alternative, [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/).

By choosing Amplify as infrastructure and CI there are certain choises that are made and desisoins that are taken for you.

Notes:
* Some adjustments to make nextjs fit to Amplify
  * "next build && next export" identifies that itÂ´s a SSG (static site generation) app.
  * Amplify needs a trailing slash at the end of signin URI
* User yarn and not npm
* Need to use the "amplify" command from adding/removing components from your app and for CI commands.
* Mono/multi-repo - Choose the best match for local dev and CI env.
* Folder structure - Find a structure for best matching local dev and CI env

What took time:
* Trying to remove phantom Amplify app
* Change repo and path for multi-repo
* Force push on master made it break

Errors:
* There was an issue connecting to your repo provider, click "Reconnect repository" in General Settings, and then try your build again.
* Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './aws-exports' in '/codebuild/output/src049202397/src/demo-amplify-blue/src'

Warnings:
* [https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/#prerequisites](https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/#prerequisites)
* Lots of deprecated and security warnings from build and setup

## Build Settings
If you change from mono- to multi-repo, or react to nextjs, you might need to change ```baseDirectory``` and ```appRoot``` in the Build Settings to reflect the change.
