# IP Camera

## ONVIF
ONVIF stands for Open Network Video Interface Forum. Its aim is to provide a standard for the interface between different IP-based security devices. In simple terms, ONVIF specifications provide a consistent way for devices from multiple manufacturers to work together

## RTSP
ONVIF uses RTSP so, by definition, more systems will support RTSP than ONVIF. However, ONVIF adds lots of advanced functionalities (camera configuration, authentication, VMD, PTZ control, i/o, etc.) beyond the basic streaming that RTSP supports.
