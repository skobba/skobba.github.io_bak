# Oauth 2.0

*Up until 2019, the OAuth 2.0 spec only recommended using the PKCE extension for mobile and JavaScript apps. The latest OAuth Security BCP now recommends using PKCE also for server-side apps, as it provides some additional benefits there as well. It is likely to take some time before common OAuth services adapt to this new recommendation, but if youâ€™re building a server from scratch you should definitely support PKCE for all types of clients.*

## Authorization Code Flow with PKCE in conjunction with Silent Refresh
*Use of the Implicit Flow in SPAs presents security challenges requiring explicit mitigation strategies. You can use the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE in conjunction with Silent Authentication to renew sessions in SPAs.*

* [https://auth0.com/docs/login/configure-silent-authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/login/configure-silent-authentication)

Auth Server (AS) and Client (SPA) flow:
1. SPA redirects user to log in with AS.
2. AS logs user in and redirects back to the SPA with an access token that can be used to access an API
3. SPA calls API until it gets 401. (or uses some other mechanism to figure out time to get new access token)
4. SPA does a silent GET to the AS authorize endpoint in attempt to get new access token.
5. I IF AND ONLY user still has a valid session with AS (some sort of auth cookie likely) then AS will respond with valid access token (if AS believes the request is valid).
