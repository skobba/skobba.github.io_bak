# Oauth 2.0

*Up until 2019, the OAuth 2.0 spec only recommended using the PKCE extension for mobile and JavaScript apps. The latest OAuth Security BCP now recommends using PKCE also for server-side apps, as it provides some additional benefits there as well. It is likely to take some time before common OAuth services adapt to this new recommendation, but if youâ€™re building a server from scratch you should definitely support PKCE for all types of clients.*
