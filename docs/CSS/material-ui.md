## Palette colors
The theme exposes the following palette colors (accessible under theme.palette.):

```primary``` - used to represent primary interface elements for a user. It's the color displayed most frequently across your app's screens and components.

```secondary``` - used to represent secondary interface elements for a user. It provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product. Having it is optional.

```error``` - used to represent interface elements that the user should be made aware of.

```warning``` - used to represent potentially dangerous actions or important messages.

```info``` - used to present information to the user that is neutral and not necessarily important.

```success``` - used to indicate the successful completion of an action that user triggered.
