# nftables
nftables offers a modern and efficient solution for network filtering and packet manipulation on Linux systems, and it is gradually becoming the standard firewall framework for many Linux distributions.

iptables-nft is a compatibility layer introduced in Debian 10 (Buster) to provide a bridge between the traditional iptables command and the newer nftables framework.
