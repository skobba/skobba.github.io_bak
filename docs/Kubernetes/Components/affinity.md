# Affinity

## Hard/Soft
* __Hard affinity__ AKA "required node affinity", defined in the pod template under spec: ___affinity:nodeAffinity:requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution___. This specifies conditions that a node must meet for a pod to schedule to it.
* __Soft affinity__ AKA "preferred known affinity", defined in the pod template under spec: ___affinity:nodeAffinity:preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution___. This specifies conditions that a node should preferably meet, but if they are not present, it is still okay to schedule the pod (as long as hard affinity criteria are met).

## Node Selector vs. Node Affinity
* Both node selectors and node affinity can use Kubernetes labelsâ€”metadata assigned to a node. 
* Labels allow you to specify that a pod should schedule to one of a set of nodes, which is more flexible than manually attaching a pod to a specific node.
* The difference between node selector and node affinity can be summarized as follows:
** A node selector is defined via the nodeSelector field in the pod template. It contains a set of key-value pairs that specify labels. The Kubernetes scheduler checks if a node has these labels to determine if it is suitable for running the pod.
** Node affinity is an expressive language that uses soft and hard scheduling rules, together with logical operators, to enable more granular control over pod placement.


## Label nodes
```
kubectl label nodes <target-node-name> special-node=true
```
