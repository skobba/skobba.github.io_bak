# CRD

__Custom Resource Definition - Extending kubernetes__
 
Installing CRDs involves defining custom resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
These resources extend the Kubernetes API, allowing users to define and manage their own custom objects alongside the built-in Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.

## List crd
```
kubectl get crd
```
